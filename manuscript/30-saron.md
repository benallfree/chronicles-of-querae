Tomos walked through the thoroughfare and glanced at the various shops and merchants, though he had no money and nothing to sell. And nothing to buy. Tomos thought about how content he was, as if this strange town was separate from him. The people milling about, buzzing with activity, meddling their ways through busy lives. A feeling Tomos couldn't quite identify stirred within him. A feeling that, somehow, none of this was real. Or, it wasn't important. Not to Tomos, anyway. He couldn't understand why nobody else looked troubled by this feeling.

"Tell me, boy," said a voice from slightly behind Tomos. It was coming from one of the merchant stands he had passed. Tomos turned around to see a man in dressed in a plain brown robe. He had no house symbol, wore no jewelry, and in those ways, seemed to stand out. The man's eyes were a piercing blue-green color that seemed to change as the angled shadows of passers-by stretched across his face and slipped off again.

Tomos stopped and studied the man, who seemed to have stopped mid-sentence. Tomos didn't have any way of knowing, but the wondered to himself if ever there was a man who had seen so many double moons. The deep wrinkles and folds in the man's face, his frail frame under his plan robe, and his hands with knuckles that twisted and bulged like the branches from a Proamaduna tree made Tomos fearful that one misplaced step or jolt pressed by someone in this busy marketplace may end the man.

"Do you see any beautiful women here today," the man queried to Tomos with a spark of life dancing in his eyes.

Tomos looked. He hadn't really considered women to be beautiful, or even there at all. Beauty, to Tomos, was a perfect stick for whittling, or a wooden toy born of such sticks in combination as to form a delightful shape for throwing or kicking. Tomos's sword was beautiful. Its handle was inlaid with pearl, and Tomos definitely remembered the day is father placed the sword in Tomos's hand for the first time. "The pearl in this handle," his father said, "is of your mother. When the time comes to wield it - and that time will certainly come - do not be frightened when you feel your mother's sure hand wrap around yours." Tomos didn't know what his father meant, exactly, but he was too young to even have that thought specifically, so he just accepted his father's words as a seed that would take root later.

Tomos rested his hand on the handle of his sword and thought again about beauty. But as he scanned around, he did notice something curious. There were beautiful women, many in fact, mixed in with the everyday traffic on the streets of Saron. The were nude, with curiously attractive curves, and stepped lightly. No, thought Tomos. Floated. As he looked more closely, it did seem that these women were almost *floating* as they moved. They walked normally, each with their own unique gate, but there was a *floating* quality to their motion.

"You do see them, don't you," confirmed the man as his chest rose pridefully at his accurate identification. Tomos looked at the man with a brand of bewilderment that confessed a mind absent knowledge of the depths of its lacking. He shifted his weight uncomfortably, feeling unsure of whether he might better press onward. Tomos began to lean his weight backward to distance himself from the man, but Creos tightened his claws into Tomos's shoulder and Tomos winced. Creos did not want to go.

In this moment, Tomos was only smart enough to know that this old man knew much more. Tomos felt an uneasiness about gaining whatever knowledge the man wanted to share. Something about the man was suggestive, secretive, even cagey, and Tomos didn't like how it made him feel. The man seemed slightly dangerous, or perhaps just a man accustomed to being in the possession of dangerous knowledge and wielding it skillfully. Either way, the young boy not yet of 13 double moons felt an unknown vulnerability. But Creos wanted to stay, and so they did. For a little longer, at least.

"And tell me of those beauties now, boy, do you see any wearing...jewelry?" The man probed deliberately and specifically. It made Tomos brace for a trick. The man raised his eyebrows and turned his piercing focus to the bustle of activity now at Tomos's back. Tomos broke his eyes away from the man and turned to look again. In fact, the man was man was correct. Every nude woman Tomos could see had but a single metal-banded necklace with a jewel fixed in its base. Different colors; reds, blacks, oranges, and a few glistening white ones. 

The man studied Tomos's eyes, darting between them and the targets of Tomos's gaze. "Yes, you must," said the man. Tomos felt again like he was being led down a path he did not know, but which the man knew very well. 

"Sir," said Tomos, "are you looking for someone? Is this a trick?"

"It is no trick," said the man, now with a smile beginning to reveal his old and yellowed teeth. "You see them, yes?"

"Yes. But sir--"

The man lifted his hand and shook his head. Tomos stopped speaking immediately, as if by command. The man turned and walked carefully, as if stepping through a patch of thorns, until he reached the old weathered door that marked the strange boundary and portal between the outside world of Saron and the inside world of his home. He opened the door, then turned and looked at Tomos. The man tilted his head and directed Tomos to step inside.
