# Lacosdan

Tomos looked again across the lake and studied the spark of white light. Like the others he had seen, this one faded slowly. After 5 minutes, it appeared no brighter than a lantern. After 10, a firefly. After 20, he wasn't sure he could see it at all.

"Always the brightest," Tomos wondered aloud. "Brighter than any others."

Today, standing on the shores of Lake Lacosdan and taking in its mere mile-wide breadth, Tomos's wonder finally turned to action. He snatched his sword from the rocky shore beside him and tucked it in the drawstring of his tunic. Over his left shoulder, his raven cawed from a tree limb and stared sharply at where the bright light had shone across the river.

"Yes, Creos, today we will."

Both Tomos and the raven kept their eyes fixed on the patch of forest where a star had been born. He had been calling the raven "Creos" since before he could remember. His father told him it meant "sees far" in old Bolarian, but Tomos wasn't sure if that was true. Or if he had even heard the word correctly. Or if his father had ever said it at all. It was too long ago. Tomos was too young and those days seemed impossibly hazy.

The raven watched with some interest as Tomos walked back to his hut - it was more of a lean-to, but not bad work for a boy - and emerged with a leather satchel. It had a single broad strap affixed. Creos had only seen the satchel when Tomos intended to travel without certain knowledge of food and water along the way. Which, for Tomos, had been a long time. It had been at least seven double moons since he had finished charting the island on which he had spent his young and few years. A feeling of flight over water stirred in Creos. The bird looked alternately between Tomos, the satchel, and the dark, clear Lacosdan waters.
