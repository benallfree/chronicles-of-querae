# Names of Querae

Querae - The name given to the power and interplay of the spiritual energy forces Qkue and Raeh. So powerful and fundamental is this energy, that it is also used as a salutation, farewell, and expression of gratitude. In the common language, it has come to mean roughly "good seeking" or "may that which seeks you be found". Querae is also the name of the mystical source where Master and slave first find each other and bond. The Querae source often appears as a tree of life-energy, shifting in colors, shape, and form.

Qkue - The first energy, generally flowing strongest in males. It calls forth a passion to create, manage, decide, solve, possess, protect, act with integrity and love, and shape the world.

Raeh - The second energy, generally flowing strongest in females. It calls forth a passion to receive protection, be led, fearlessly love, bring forth, be useful, be loyal, and serve.

Tomos Strongkreid - A young Qkue discovering the power of Querae. 

Saron - The town of Saron is where Tomos first learns of the Querae and those seekers who follow it.

Parodus - The mystical man of Saron who tells Tomos about the Querae.

Creos - Tomos's raven who possesses animal wisdom.

Traeca - A tree of flexible branches and soft, down-like leaves.

Capaer - A tree that responds to distress. Often used for weapons and canes, the wood is pliable and flexible, but becomes rigid instantly when in the hands of a distressed holder. So strong is the Capaer wood that no known force can break a distressed piece. Elders prefer Caeaer wood for walking, because it is soft when needed but can hold tremendous weight when needed.

Lake Lacosdan - The clear and deadly uncrossable water separating Tomos's island home from the rest of the known world. No Raeh can survive the poisoned water, and destructive black waves push back any sailors who attempt to cross it. 

Lacosdan Forest - The forest where Meuric and many other Querae seekers live.

Meuric - Tomos' Querae Master. 

Proamaduna - A stubby shrub-like tree with layers of twisted, knotty trunk and think branches. Considered to have no nutritional value, but good for fire wood.
