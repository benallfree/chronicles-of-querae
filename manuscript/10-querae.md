# Querae

She straddled his body and rhythmically rolled her hips as she slid up and down his hard cock. Sinking down and burying it completely, then lifting up until the head of his dick popped just out of her elastic tight inner pussy lips. Just as she was taught, being careful to keep her glistening outer lips firmly around his manhood. And then, sinking down again. Over and over, squeezing and milking his cock, just as he had trained her.

Twigs cracked beneath him. He gazed up at the trees plunging into the sky as he plunged into her. "Good girl," said her Master. "Milk your Master's dick." And she did, never breaking eye contact. In fact, this was the only time she was allowed and required to maintain eye contact with her Master. When using her, he demanded complete connection and to receive the full measure of her attention.

She began to feel his dick stiffin in her and she knew her command was nearly complete. Instinctively, she shifted her weight to roll her ass down more toward his balls. This allowed her to massage his shaft firmly to prepare him for a full and explosive release.

With her hands gripping his muscular chest, he grabbed her hips and began grinding her onto his manhood.

"Master..." she said weakly. The slave began to flush a warm color of red and beads of sweat began to glisten between her breasts.

"No, pet," said the Master. "Not yet."

"Master..." she urged him again, her orgasm building. His dick was touching her so deeply and sweetly that it was sending electric sparks up her spine. Her lips parted slightly and he could see the light beginning in her mouth. Her eyes began to soften and drift.

"No pet, still not yet. Stay here."

He could feel her beginning to lose rhythm and gave her a firm swat on her young ass. With that, her mouth snapped shut and her eyes sharpened on his again. With new determination, she squeezed his dick even harder and he thrust her hips down even deeper.

The slave almost couldn't maintain her focus at all now. Her chest and cheeks began to grow brighter. The light he glimpsed in her mouth could now be seen moving slowly down her belly toward her pussy which was still wrapped tightly around his rod.

"Master!", she cried, now making no attempt to hide the light escaping her open mouth. "Master, I can't hold on!"

Light began to escape from between her fingers and toes, and behind her ears. Her back was glowing a soft rosy pink.

"You can and you will, pet."

With that, he pushed her hips down so hard that she couldn't move. He exploded deep into his slave as wave after wave of his hot seed filled her. She squeezed his dick with each spurt, just as he had taught her. Now glowing brightly all over her body, she arched her spine. Light was spilling from her fingers, toes, mouth, and now her eyes, which were still locked on his.

"Master," she sighed with ecstatic desperation, "Would it please you if I come now?"

"Yes pet, you may come now."

With that command, the slave sunk down on her Master's dick and touched off the final spark within her. She moaned as the wave of ecstasy overcame her, eyes still locked directly on his. A bright, white light began deep within her heart. Every curve and angle of the slave begin to emit energetic light. The sphere of light that began in her heart grew so bright that her Master could no longer see any part of her. The sphere took on a lifelike presence and motion, then broke its form into thousands of rays, each again splitting into thousands more. Light eclipsed her entire body and shot brightly from her in all directions as she relaxed into her natural form. The Master's slave became a shimmering presence of pure energy. A portal to the other realm opened in her space, and pure bliss of the unmanifested flowed from her and bathed her Master.

Her pussy clamped down one final time to drink up the last of his seed as her wet divine nectar poured down around his cock. She would not break her connection with his cock until he was was completely drained and the transfer of her energy to him was complete. She screamed and dug her nails into his chest, just as he had taught her.

The white light of divine release cut through the forest as if a star had been born right where they lay. Across the lake, a boy stared at the bright light shimmering amidst the trees. He had seen it before.

"Querae, Master."
