# Parodus

The man stood in his doorway, waiting for Tomos to leave the streets of Saron and pass through into the man's house. Tomos tried to think of any reason not to go into the man's house, but having come to Saron as he did, seeing the great black wave of Lacosdan that almost killed him, and with the arrow splitting still fresh in his mind, Tomos could find no reason to remain cautious. Creos took from Tomos's shoulder and settled on a rafter of the even overhanging the man's door. Tomos felt the man's rough robe as he brushed past the man and entered the house.

Tomos walked slowly and took in the dwelling. One wall featured shelves lined with dusty corked clay bottles of varying colors, opacities, shapes, and sizes. Some had two handles, others with just one. Some with no handles at all. There seemed to be no pattern to them, not that Tomos thought there should be. The lack of organization gave Tomos a playful feeling, and he liked it.

A three-legged table that appeared to be an old wagon wheel was the centerpiece of the man's humble one-room dwelling. The chairs were stumps. Off in the corner, Tomos saw a bed of soft Traeca branches and a neatly folded blanket and assumed the man slept there. A small fire pit and makeshift metal chimney, an assortment of shelves and dressers, and a solitary walking Capaer cane in the far corner completed the scene.

Tomos jumped at the startling sound of the door closing behind him. The man stood, now with softer eyes, and looked at Tomos.

"I am Parodus," said the man. "And you, well - we will get to all that. Sit, young man, sit." Parodus gestured to the far stump of the table as he shuffled to a small sack sitting atop a wooden chest of drawers. He loosed the drawstrings of the sack and drew a piece of bread from it. With each step Parodus took, Tomos thought he saw pain the man's eyes. A limp, perhaps.

Parodus set the small loaf of bread in front of Tomos and then sat down with a grunt of pain escaping his mouth. "Eat," said the man, "and let us share words."

Tomos picked up the bread and tore a piece off. The hard shell of the bread gave way to a soft center, and Tomos delighted in it. Back home on Lacosdan Island, there was no bread to eat. Tomos popped a ball of bread in his mouth and nodded his head, curious what the man would say next.

"Tell me boy, what is it you think you saw out there?"

"I saw ladies," Tomos answered without embarrassment. "Naked ladies wearing necklaces, as you asked, Sir."

"And what of the necklaces? Did you see any without necklaces?"

"No," answered Tomos again. "They all had necklaces."

"Yes," said Parodus. "Yes, they did."

Tomos didn't understand the old man's curiosity. He had only small fragmented memories of life before Lacosdan Island, and from what he remembered, there was nothing unusual about nude women tending to they day's events in necklaces with sparkling gemstones. In fact, this was such an ordinary fact that Tomos puzzled over the old man's excitement.

"And think, boy. Think hard. Have you *ever* seen one without a necklace?" Tomos thought as hard as he could and it made his face pinch into a frown. 

"Well, I don't think so," said Tomos unsurely. "No, I guess not."

Parodus leaned back and studied Tomos intently before nodding his head affirmatively. "You will, young man. You will."

"Sir, I am on my way to the Lacosdan forest. Thank you for the bread, but I must continue my journey. I am afraid I may not get there at all if I stop to answer questions of old men."

At this, Parodus erupted with laughter. "No, young warrior, you will not! For every answer in this life, there are a thousand, thousand questions. You can not be kept to answer them all."

Tomos nodded his head in agreement. "Thank you sir, for the bread and conversation. If you can point me toward the path to Lacosdan Forest, I will set upon it."

The man got up, with some difficulty, and limped back to the bread sack. He reached in and his hand emerged from the sack with an apple. Tomos rose from the table and they both walked to the door and made their way outside.

As Tomos turned to leave, the old man touched Tomos's shoulder and turned Tomos to face him. Parodus extended the apple toward Tomos.

Tomos reached for the apple as the old man slowly set it in Tomos's hand. Tomos grasped it eagerly and began to pull it to his mouth, but the mysterious man did not let go. Tomos tried to let go, thinking he had misunderstood Parodus's gesture, but Tomos found he could not let go either. It was as if some mutual force was keeping them both connected to the apple.

Everything around Tomos slowed to a halt. The breeze stopped in place. Horses, people walking, dogs barking; sights and sounds alike stopped, and Tomos could see it all frozen in time. It seemed that even the rays of light had stopped, as he could see them individually. The world around him was a fragmented fiction of reflections and vibrations frozen at a single point. Even Creos's sharp glassy eyes seemed to be nothing more than billions of light rays reflecting back. It made Tomos think about whether anything was really here at all. 

But Parodus was still there. Tomos looked at Parodus with a puzzled look. "Sir?"

"There was a time, closer to beginning times, when there where more of us. More who could see truth. Who could see past what is and into what is. The graceful beings you see once covered the land and filled men's hearts with peace and joy. You don't know it yet, but you will. Not all see as we do. There are those who would see your gifts put to ill purpose. Follow the path North and seek Master Meuric. Share nothing you have seen or said but with Meuric and only Meuric. Some day, you may see an angel without a necklace. When you do, well that is truly a good day. Until then, there is work to do."

Tomos took in the man's words while still holding the apple. It was then that Tomos realized the man's lips were not moving. Instead, Tomos and Parodus stood there, connected together, exchanging pure emotion and understanding.

"And one more thing," emoted Parodus. "Never travel alone, young Tomos Strongkreid."

Tomos's eyes widened as the old man spoke his name. At once, Parodus let go of the apple and the connection was broken. Life snapped back into motion and resumed as if nothing had been lost or noticed. The rays of light, fragmented and individual just moments before, coalesced into a concert of solid images and action. Dogs and children resumed play, horses resumed trotting, and wagon wheels resumed rolling.

The mystic's thinning gray beard blew gently in the breeze stirring the morning air.  Tomos felt peaceful and serene, as if he had just awoken from a long nap. Without another word, he looked toward the North road out of Saron and began walking. Creos flapped his wings and glided back to Tomos's shoulder. Parodus watched until Tomos was out of site.

Tomos stopped at the edge of Saron. The main road out of Saron bent West, but Tomos was not looking there. Instead, Tomos stared into a small, shadowy path that narrowed and led North. Overgrown grass sprouted from the disused trail. Once, a wooden sign post reading Olde Lak O'sdhan in carefully carved script had stood marking the path, but that had since rotted and fallen into the overgrowth that consumed it.

Tomos turned to look at Creos, who was already looking at Tomos.

"Are we alone, Creos?"
